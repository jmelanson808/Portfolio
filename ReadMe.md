Welcome to my professional portfolio. This serves as a showcase for my best work done as an undergraduate student at Westminster University. A current copy of my resume is includeed in this repository, and links to each individual project repository is listed below. With each link, I will provide a brief summary of what the project is, the challenges I overcame, and key lessons learned during its development. Each of these projects also helped me in reaching at least one of the learning goals in Westminster's Computer Sciencee Program, which are listed here:

1: To attain a system-level understanding of the computer.  
2: To understand the concepts and techniques of software design.  
3: To acquire significant project experience working both individually and in a group setting.  
4: To develop effective problem solving skills.

Zen Spelling is a browser-based educational game developed over a semester with 3 other collaborators under the team name Jasper. It is an interactive educational tool designed for elementary school students from grades 1-5, with its primary function as a way for teachers to augmment their grammar/spelling curriculum. Students are able to place tiles on a grid and design a beautiful garden, prompted to answer spelling challenges for each tile. Teachers have access to an administrative panel to manage student accounts and create their own spelling challenges to better match curriculum. The backend was implemented with Django and the frontend was built with vanilla Javascript.

The biggest challenge we had as a team was deciding on our tech stack, with many conversations about what to use for the frontend. Our experience with frontend frameworks was limited at the time, and we had concerns about excessive time spent learning new tech with such tight deadlines for release. This did make implementing certain things much mmore challenging than they needed to be, but I believe it was the right decision at the time to preserve a united effort from the team. In retrospect, using a framework like Angular or a game engine like Godot would have been better, and depending on how the rest of Team Jasper feels, we may pick this back up using one of those tools.

Zen Spelling is my largest project to date, and was a significant learning experience for all of us on the team. I spearheaded the majority of the design process, using Miro and Figma to create mockups, wireframes, interactive prototypes, and flowcharts for UI/UX design. I used what I learned at my internship to establish strict protocols for the development pipeline, including code reviews, feature branches, Kanban workflow, testing plans, and merging via pull requests. The majority of my development focus was on the frontend, but I still needed to be knowledgeable enough in Django to integrate my code effectively with the backend. Each member of the team worked as a cohesive unit, in constant communication via Discord and in-class standups, and teaming up when needed to push through a difficult story. The commplexity, length, and team-based approach of Zen Spelling helped me reach all of the program's learning goals, and I would love to continue improving on it in the future.

Project 2: Asteroids

<a href="https://github.com/jmelanson808/Asteroids_Game" target="_blank">Click here to visit project repo</a>   

This was my final project for the Data Structures & Algorithms course. It is a simple program that launches my version of the classic Asteroids game. Players use the arrow keys to control their ship, and the space key to fire. This project is a perfect exercise for object-oriented programming, featuring a class for every major component of the program (ship, bullet, asteroid, etc.), and each class handling the behavior of its object. I had to spend a lot of time designing what each object needed to do during runtime, including what it would do when certain events occured. A simple example would be moving the ship across the screen when the player pushes an arrow key, and a complex example would be how the asteroids break apart and turn into many smaller asteroids when hit by a bullet or another asteroid, each with new directions/velocity! This project helped me develop better problem solving skills, a more organized approach to designing a program, and a deeper understanding of object oriented programming.
